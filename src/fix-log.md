---

## [v11.0] – 2025-05-23

## 🛠 Fixes Made

### 🧱 Layout & Routing

- Restored `/add-ons` route and ensured it's accessible via `App.tsx`
- Fixed missing `index.css` import in `main.tsx` (Tailwind not loading)
- Aligned layout container to 1200px using Tailwind grid system
- Re-added sticky `FooterNav` with proper spacing and 1200px max-width

### 🔄 State Management (PlanContext)

- Added `selectedAddOns[]`, `updateAddOn()`, `clearAddOns()` to context
- Rebuilt `togglePlan()` logic to support full plan object instead of ID
- Restored `setSelectedPlans()` and `isModalOpen` to global context

### 🧩 Add-On Cards

- Created reusable `AddOnCard` component with quantity controls and clear selection
- Wired `AddOnCard` into `PlanContext` using `updateAddOn()`

### 📦 Data Integration

- Hooked up `mobilePlanData.ts` and `addOnData.ts` with placeholder JSON
- Confirmed rendering with card grids and correct props

### 📋 FooterNav

- Reused v10.2 layout
- Added selection awareness for Mobile Plans (count, clear all, view modal)
- Modal wired to show current `selectedPlans`

### 🧪 Filtering & Modal Debugging

- Repaired broken filters (`network`, `data`, `type`)
- Discovered `contract`, `roaming`, `features` filters not working — deferred to v12
- Fixed modal not showing selected plans by passing correct full plan objects

---

## 🚫 Issues That Caused Delays

- Tailwind not applying due to missing CSS import
- State mismatch from passing plan ID instead of full object
- Overwriting previously working layout/components instead of building on top
- ZIP files sent but not always fully reviewed before modifying

---

## [v11.1] – 2025-05-23

---

## [v12.0] – 2025-05-24

### ✅ Summary

🛠️ Milestone v12 – Emergency Recovery Summary (Thread Closure)

v11.4 was the last fully working version. Milestone v12 introduced improvements (footer summary, modal UX consistency, selection logic), but due to file mismatches, assumptions, and structural oversights, the project reached an unstable state.

### ⚠️ Problem Summary

Several key issues arose during the v12 milestone:

1. **Broken Preview (Blank Screen)**

   - `/mobile-plans` and `/add-ons` failed to load.
   - Console errors included:
     - `Uncaught SyntaxError`: named export mismatch in `/addOnData.ts`
     - `selectedPlans.some is not a function`
     - `TypeError: map is not a function` from modal logic

2. **PlanContext Desync**

   - `clearAddOns`, `updateAddOn`, and `setIsModalOpen` were inconsistently implemented or missing across pages.

3. **Double Modal / Ghost Overlay Bug**

   - Reverted modal logic caused overlapping modals and background blur issues.
   - Used outdated pattern: `hasSelections && renderModal()` in `FooterNav`.

4. **Import Errors**

   - Incorrect assumption of `addOnData` as default export (`import addOnData from ...`) vs actual `export const addOnData`.

5. **AddOnCard vs MobilePlanCard Mismatch**

   - `AddOnCards` failed due to:
     - Missing props
     - Incorrect quantity logic
     - Outdated interface
     - Fields like `quantity`, `network`, and `data` passed unnecessarily

6. **FooterNav Styling and Logic Regression**
   - Max-width and button styles were lost.
   - Multiple versions of `FooterNav` used inconsistently, leading to merge conflicts.

### 💡 Root Causes

- Too many files were edited in parallel without validation.
- Incorrect assumptions around:
  - Export/import patterns
  - Shared context structure
- Lack of diff-checking against v11.4 before applying v12 changes.
- Modal and `FooterNav` logic were not tested incrementally.
- Context logic (`setIsModalOpen`) fragmented and inconsistently wired.

### ✅ What’s Been Done

- Reverted to `src-v11.4.zip` as stable recovery base.
- Identified broken imports (`addOnData`, `AddOnCard`) as key blockers.
- Located misalignment between Add-ons and Mobile Plans architecture.
- Reconfirmed which components work correctly in `v11.4`.
- Flagged reusable parts of v12 for future safe reintroduction after restoring stability.

---

## [v12.1] – 2025-05-25

## 🔄 Background

This milestone followed a broken state inherited from milestone v12 where:

- Add-on cards were visible, but **selection logic was broken**
- FooterNav did not activate correctly based on quantity
- Modal and selection updates were out of sync
- Description text truncation was not working
- Layout height was rigid and spacing inconsistent

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. 🔁 AddOnCards → Context Integration Restored

- Rewired `AddOnCards.tsx` to use `usePlanContext()` directly
- Correctly passed `onUpdate` and `onClear` into each `AddOnCard`
- Used `getQuantity()` to match current selection state

### 2. 📥 FooterNav Summary Update

- Changed summary logic from `.length` to `.reduce()` to reflect **total quantity selected**
- Updated UI to display “75 add-ons selected” instead of “3 add-ons selected”

### 3. 🧩 Modal Behavior Restored

- Modal correctly disables Update until changes are made
- Update button applies changes and closes modal
- Selections persist and update context correctly

### 4. 💄 AddOnCard Visual Layout Overhaul

- Removed `h-[260px]` fixed height to allow content-based resizing
- Reorganized structure to place info icon top-right, title top-left
- Moved “Clear selection” to align right of quantity controls
- Restructured button and badge alignment
- Confirmed badge highlight and quantity state visually sync correctly

### 5. ✂️ Description Truncation (Multiple Failed Attempts)

- Multiple attempts made using:
  - `truncate`, `overflow-hidden`, `whitespace-nowrap`, `w-full`
  - `max-w-full`, `min-w-0`, `block` wrapper
  - Outer wrapping `divs` with `flex`/`grid` break mitigation
- Final fallback: placeholder text used (`"Description TBD"`) to stop overflow

### 6. 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Manual user testing confirmed:
  - Quantity state now functional
  - Modal working
  - FooterNav updates
  - Visual consistency restored
  - Description no longer breaks layout

## 📝 Notes

- Description truncation failed repeatedly due to layout context (flex/grid)
- Resolved by using static placeholder text temporarily
- All other functionality restored and UI stabilized

## [v12.2] – 2025-05-26

## 📅 Date: [Insert completion date]

## 🧩 Related Milestone: v12.2

## 🎯 Goal:

Restore the Add-ons step of the CPQ system after losing visual functionality (blank preview), syncing broken due to previous iterative changes in v12.1.

## ✅ Summary of Actions Taken

1. **Initial State**

   - The Add-ons page was showing a blank screen.
   - User confirmed the Mobile Plans page was still functioning.
   - Multiple file versions from v12.1 caused confusion: e.g. `SelectedAddOnsModal (1).tsx`, `AddOns-v11.5.tsx`, `FooterNav-fixed.tsx`.
   - Imports were misaligned; some components were imported under incorrect names or from outdated variants.

2. **Files Consolidated & Reviewed**

   - `/pages/AddOns.tsx`
   - `/components/FooterNav.tsx`
   - `/components/SelectedAddOnsModal.tsx`
   - `/components/AddOnCard.tsx`
   - `/context/PlanContext.tsx`
   - All backups were moved into `_backup` folders by the user for clarity.

3. **Fixes Attempted**

   - `FooterNav.tsx` was updated to:
     - Always show Continue button
     - Only show View/Clear when selections exist
     - Match logic to the Mobile Plans page
   - `AddOnCard.tsx`:
     - Fixed badge quantity logic and visual state reset
     - Added prop types
   - `SelectedAddOnsModal.tsx`:
     - Fixed update/removal behavior
     - Confirmed modal closes on update
   - `AddOns.tsx`:
     - Rewired modal and FooterNav with correct handlers (`onView`, `onClear`, `onContinue`)
   - `PlanContext.tsx`:
     - Confirmed all state, update, and clear methods are available

4. **Persistent Issues**
   - Blank screen continued even after applying updated files
   - Console error not provided during final testing
   - Unclear whether the blank preview stemmed from:
     - Incorrect file actually rendered
     - Crashing component (e.g. modal, badge, footer)

## ❌ Key Failures

- Multiple updates sent under different filenames added confusion
- Some updates assumed older files were still active or that renaming had occurred
- A final working ZIP was sent but was empty due to session persistence error
- Blank preview could not be resolved in-thread due to lack of live error data

## 🔚 Outcome

- User requested full reset
- All final files (`AddOns.tsx`, `AddOnCard.tsx`, `FooterNav.tsx`, `SelectedAddOnsModal.tsx`, `PlanContext.tsx`) were resent as individual working files
- Handover document created to begin v12.3 in a new thread

## 🔄 Suggested Starting Point for v12.3

- Begin with PlanContext and AddOns.tsx
- Validate each UI component (FooterNav, Modal, Card) one by one
- Require browser console log from user if preview is blank again

---

## [v13.0] – 2025-05-26

### ✅ Summary

Milestone v13.0 restored full Add-ons page functionality after extended debugging of runtime crashes and selection state issues. The root cause was ultimately traced to `addOnData.ts` using incorrectly typed string values for `price`, which broke card rendering, sorting, and modal display logic. Replacing these with `number` values resolved all crashing behavior and restored visual and logical sync across components.

### 💡 Highlights

- Replaced `price: "£6/month"` with `price: 6.0` for all add-ons
- Rewrote `AddOnCards.tsx` with strict guards for undefined props
- Updated `AddOnCard.tsx` to receive and format price as number
- Ensured sorting works using direct numeric values
- Confirmed `selectedAddOns` now persists `qty` and context updates properly
- FooterNav now counts selected add-ons and disables “Continue” when none
- Modal opens with valid data and updates context correctly

### 🔧 Technical Changes

- `addOnData.ts` updated to use number for all price fields
- `AddOnCard.tsx` no longer crashes on `toFixed()` call
- `AddOnCards.tsx` verifies `addOns` is an array before `.filter`
- Cards now render and react to badge selections
- Footer summary quantity reflects `qty`, not just card count
- Modal button disables/enables based on actual changes
- All layout and functionality matches prior working milestone (v11.4) + enhancements

### ⏭️ Next Steps

- Visual polish of Add-on badges and price spacing
- Optional: Add tooltips and accessibility support
- Optional: Persist filters or selection to localStorage

---

## [v13.5] – 2025-05-27

### ❌ Summary

Milestone v13.5 was intended to:
- Duplicate the Add-ons page to create a new Hardware step
- Finalise filters, selection, and modal logic across both pages
- Get Tailwind CSS fully styled and visible in a new StackBlitz environment

### ❌ Key Roadblock

The milestone was disrupted after the user exceeded CodeSandbox’s free credit limit (40 hours), locking down their project unexpectedly. They transitioned to StackBlitz and imported the last working backup (v13.0) to continue progress.

### 🧩 Work Completed

- Hardware page created by duplicating `AddOns.tsx` and connected to `/hardware` route
- `hardwareData.ts` scaffolded and wired to `PlanContext` with new `selectedHardware` bucket
- FooterNav updated to conditionally render logic across `/mobile-plans`, `/add-ons`, and `/hardware`
- All components confirmed functional, modals wired, and summary logic aligned
- StackBlitz project successfully created and GitHub repo connected for persistence

### ⚠️ Tailwind Blocker

Despite Tailwind being installed and configured:
- Styles did not visually render as expected
- Tailwind worked in isolation (`text-4xl`, `bg-blue-500` tests confirmed functional)
- Page components already had Tailwind classes (`AddOns.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, etc.)
- Vite and PostCSS were properly wired
- The issue was narrowed down to either: 
  - Tailwind not compiling full styles at build
  - StackBlitz not resolving the build correctly
  - A potential purge/content config issue or layout-related oversight

### 🔚 Outcome

Milestone was paused with Tailwind partially rendering but not applying to routed components. All UI and routing logic remains intact. A new milestone (v13.6) will be used to re-establish full styling in StackBlitz and complete polish on Add-ons + Hardware steps.

### ⏭️ Next Steps

- Milestone v13.6: Fully resolve Tailwind visibility issue in StackBlitz
- Validate `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `vite.config.ts` structure
- Confirm content scanning scope and rebuild UI styling structure
- Restore expected styled layout for Add-ons and Hardware pages

---

## [v13.6] – 2025-05-27

### 🎯 Goal  
Resolve Tailwind styling issue in StackBlitz and complete layout fixes left open from v13.5 (Cards, Filter Panel, Page Layouts).

---

### 🔄 Fixes & Updates

- [ ] Verified GitHub repo integration from StackBlitz
- [ ] Confirmed `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` exist
- [ ] Adjusted `vite.config.ts` to correctly resolve PostCSS
- [ ] Verified `index.css` imports Tailwind utilities (`@tailwind base`, etc.)
- [ ] Rebuilt layout test using Tailwind utility classes (confirmed in `App.tsx`)
- [ ] (TO DO) Identify and restore missing layout styling for card and filter wrappers
- [ ] (TO DO) Confirm classes like `max-w-[1200px]` and `p-4` render correctly
- [ ] (TO DO) Confirm `bg-gray-50`, `rounded`, `shadow` etc. are output
- [ ] (TO DO) Test Tailwind purge logic — ensure it's not stripping needed classes

---

### 🧪 Validation
- [ ] Visually confirm cards render styled and structured in browser
- [ ] Console log Tailwind classes if needed to confirm they're not stripped
- [ ] Confirm updates persist and push to GitHub
- [ ] test 1,2,3, 4, 5
