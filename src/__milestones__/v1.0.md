ðŸš€ **Starting Milestone vXX â€“ [Title of Milestone]**

### ðŸ“‚ Attachments included:

- âœ… `_projectMilestones/v1.0.md` â€“ milestone plan and scope
- âœ… `fix-log.md` â€“ clean slate from this point onward
- âœ… `assumptions.md` â€“ updated to reflect StackBlitz transition

---

### ðŸ”§ Context

This milestone marks the **first fully working setup within StackBlitz**, following many failed attempts in CodeSandbox and early StackBlitz environments.

We now have:

- TailwindCSS fully working with React + Vite
- All components, context, and pages restored and rendering correctly
- Initial router setup working via `react-router-dom`
- A baseline project titled `cpq-mobile-v1`

This milestone will act as the **baseline reference** for future enhancements and builds.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- âœ… Lock and snapshot this baseline environment
- âœ… Push to GitHub under a `v1.0` tag or branch
- âœ… Define next milestone scope (v1.1): Add-ons summary, FooterNav updates, etc.

Letâ€™s make this one smooth and efficient.
