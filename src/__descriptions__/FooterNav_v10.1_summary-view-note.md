# FooterNav v10.1 – Summary View and Clear All Footer Enhancements

📅 Date: 2025-05-22  
🔢 Version: v10.1

---

### Summary

This update adds a visual footer summary interaction to help users confirm their selections. The number of selected mobile plans is displayed beside the Continue button, along with options to "View" and "Clear All".

The View action opens a modal showing a simplified list of selected plans. This is purely informational, with a Close button only. The Clear All action resets the current selection state to empty. The Continue button remains disabled if no plans are selected.

---

### Functional Goals

- Improve user feedback around plan selection count
- Allow users to preview selections before continuing
- Provide a lightweight method for clearing all selections

---

### UI Behavior

- ✅ “X selected” text shown when `selectedPlans.length > 0`
- ✅ “View” opens modal (with transition) showing selected plans
- ✅ “Clear All” resets `selectedPlans[]` in parent scope
- ✅ Modal includes:
  - Plan title
  - Monthly price
  - Close button

---

### Technical Summary

- `FooterNav.tsx` updated to:
  - Accept `onClearAll`, `onViewSelected`, `selectedCount`
- `App.tsx` manages modal state with `isModalOpen`
- Modal component lives in `SelectedPlansModal.tsx`
- Plan price formatting is applied directly in modal display

---

### Known Gaps

- ⛔ Modal does not yet support removing individual plans
- ⛔ No animated transitions or accessibility focus trap
- ⛔ Modal is read-only, no plan actions yet
