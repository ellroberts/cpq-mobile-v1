# âœ… Milestone v12 â€“ Finalise Add-ons + Fix Filters

## ðŸ“… Version: v11.5 â†’ v12.0

## ðŸ”¢ Step: 3 of 5 (continues Add-ons page development and filters fix)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal & Context

This milestone focuses on completing Step 3 of the CPQ flow â€“ the **Add-ons selection page** â€“ while also resolving outstanding issues with the **Mobile Plans filters**.

We aim to stabilise:

- Add-on card layout and logic
- Shared filter panel and logic across plan and add-ons steps
- Global FooterNav behaviour
- Summary modal for selected Add-ons (matching Mobile Plans behaviour)

---

## âœ… Scope Checklist

### Add-ons Page

- [ ] Finalise add-on card styling (icon spacing, badge labels, quantity logic)
- [ ] Wire `AddOnCard.tsx` to `PlanContext` fully using `updateAddOn()` and `clearAddOns()`
- [ ] Add filter sidebar to `/add-ons`
- [ ] Integrate FooterNav (count, clear all, view modal)
- [ ] Enable View Modal for selected add-ons

### Filters (Mobile Plans)

- [ ] Fix `contract` filter logic (should match 12 or 24 months plans)
- [ ] Fix `roaming` filter (Yes/No logic against boolean or string data)
- [ ] Fix `features` multi-select filter (supports overlap, not exact match)

### Shared Components

- [ ] Ensure `FooterNav` handles step-awareness (plans vs. add-ons)
- [ ] Ensure modal summary component works for both selectedPlans and selectedAddOns

## ðŸ“‚ Attachments to Be Tracked

- `AddOnCard.tsx`
- `FiltersPanel.tsx`
- `PlanContext.tsx`
- `FooterNav.tsx`
- `SelectedAddOnsModal.tsx` (if used)
- `AddOns.tsx`
- `mobilePlanData.ts` and `addOnData.ts`

---

## ðŸ§  Design/Logic Assumptions

- Feature filtering will involve arrays (e.g., `features: ["5G", "WiFi Calling"]`)
- Roaming and contract fields may need type normalization (`Yes` vs `true`)
- FooterNav will remain sticky, scoped to 1200px
- Modal design and content layout can reuse existing plan modal structure

---

## ðŸ§  Risks or Watchouts

- Regressions in plan filters if filter logic is shared across steps without isolation
- Add-ons selection UI may need to support quantity, unlike plans
- FooterNav logic must remain step-aware to avoid showing the wrong context

---

## ðŸ§© Kickoff Notes

- Carry forward all versioned files from v11.5 as baseline
- No overwriting of known-good components without explicit agreement
- ZIPs will be used for major change tracking
- Assumptions log and fix-log will be updated at each sub-milestone checkpoint
