Starting from latest stable structure confirmed post v12.2

All files cross-checked and working as of 2025-05-26

User confirmed working files are loaded and preview is rendering

Filters must be fully wired with onChange, toggleFilter, and selection logic per type

All changes to be made incrementally with tested preview
